# React Portfolio

Fifteenth bootcamp challenge using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research (YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make an updated portfolio using React. When you load the application, you are greeted with a header, a section for content, and a footer. When you view the header, you see the developer's name and navigation tabs for different sections of the portfolio. When you click the different nav buttons, the URL changes to reflect what section you chose. The initial loading page is the About page, which presents you with a recent photo an a brief bio. The portfolio page presents 6 applications with links, images, titles, and a small description. The contact page presents input fields for name, email, and a message (If all fields are not filled out, it presents with an alert). The resume page presents a button to download the developer's resume and a list of proficiencies. The footer presents the different social links to find the developer at.
